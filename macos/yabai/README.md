# Yabai configuration

This is my configuration for [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), a tiling window manager for macOS.  
The `yabai` features I use are limited because I'm running with System Integrity Protection enabled. Therefore, I combine this with native macOS features and keybindings.
