# Karabiner-Elements Configuration

This is my [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) configuration.
I currently use Karabiner for two reasons:

- Mapping `CapsLock` to a virtual `HyperKey`, which I use for custom keybindings.
- Remapping keys on Windows keyboards to make them more Mac-friendly.
