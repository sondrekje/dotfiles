# IdeaVim configuration

This is my configuration file for the [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) plugin, which brings Vim emulation to JetBrains IDEs.

This setup is evolving as I continue to tweak it. I'm also working to better synchronize my keybindings between ``.ideavimrc`` and ``.vimrc``.

**Note**: Some of the plugins utilized in the `ideavimrc` file require additional IDE extensions in order to work properly. Make sure to install any necessary extensions before using the configuration.
