# Vim configuration

This is my current vim configuration file, managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management.

The configuration requires Vim9, as it integrates with, but is not limited to, the following Vim9-specific plugins:
- [lsp](https://github.com/yegappan/lsp) - An (LSP) Language Server Protocol plugin for Vim9
- [vimcomplete](https://github.com/girishji/vimcomplete) - A lightwight asynchronous autocompletion plugin for Vim9

The setup is evolving as I continue to tweak it. I also aim to better synchronize my keybindings between ``.ideavimrc`` and ``.vimrc``.
