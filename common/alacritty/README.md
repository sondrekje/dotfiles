# Alacritty configuration

This is my configuration file for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator written in Rust.

The color scheme in this configuration is based on the **vim-habamax** theme.
A special thanks to [habamax](https://github.com/habamax) for creating the [vim-habamax colorscheme](https://github.com/habamax/vim-habamax).
