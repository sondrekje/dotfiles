# oh-my-posh configuration

This is my configuration for [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh), a customizable cross platform/shell prompt renderer. My motivation for switching to this was that ``powerlevel10k`` [went into life support ðŸª¦](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/issues/2690).
